# SoftPop2 Eurorack Converter

Do you want to convert your SoftPop2 to Eurorack and still have the ability to go back to desktop?

Get your SP2 Eurorack Converter from any PCB manufacturer.

This project is basically just this [BASTL Softpop Converter](https://github.com/bastl-instruments/SoftPop2_eurorack_converter) redrawn.
The main reason why this even exists, is it being created in KiCad which is open source and anyone can use it. Also I added plated holes.

Feel free to edit your own converters, and PLEASE, add your own beautiful art on it. I would love to see it!
